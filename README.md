# Trance ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ¶

An online music streaming web application that aims at shuffling the music playlist in the best way possible.

<sub>After a successful run and gaining a substantial userbase per month, I have decided to temporarily deprecate the current version of **trance**. I'm fully focused on developing an enhanced and improved version to meet the evolving needs of our users.
</sub>
<sub>
I appreciate the support and enthusiasm our users have shown for the current version of the app, and I believe that the upcoming release will surpass your musical desires. Stay tuned for updates as we progress towards the launch of v2 of **trance!**

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
## Environment Variables
